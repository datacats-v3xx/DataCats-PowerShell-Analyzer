# DataCats-PowerShell-Analyzer
üêæ PowerShell Incident Response Analyzer - DataCats‚Ñ¢ Edition

A security tool designed to analyze PowerShell scripts for potentially malicious elements, suspicious patterns, and security vulnerabilities.

## Overview

DataCats PowerShell Analyzer is a specialized security tool that helps security professionals, system administrators, and developers identify potentially harmful code in PowerShell scripts. By scanning for known malicious patterns, obfuscation techniques, and security vulnerabilities, this tool provides an additional layer of defense against PowerShell-based attacks.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**: Examines PowerShell scripts without execution to identify suspicious code patterns
- **Obfuscation Detection**: Identifies common obfuscation techniques used to hide malicious code
- **Known Exploit Detection**: Checks for patterns associated with common PowerShell-based exploits
- **Command & Function Analysis**: Analyzes commands and functions for potentially dangerous operations
- **Report Generation**: Creates detailed reports of findings with severity levels and explanations
- **Batch Processing**: Ability to scan multiple files or entire directories at once

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/datacats-v3xx/DataCats-PowerShell-Analyzer.git
cd DataCats-PowerShell-Analyzer
# Additional installation steps if required

### Basic Usage

```powershell
.\Analyze-Script.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\script.ps1"
```

### Advanced Options

```powershell
.\Analyze-Script.ps1 -Path "C:\Scripts" -Recursive -OutputFormat JSON -Severity High -ExcludeThirdParty
```

### Parameters

- `-Path`: Path to a PowerShell script or directory containing scripts
- `-Recursive`: Process subdirectories when scanning a directory
- `-OutputFormat`: Format for results (Text, CSV, JSON, HTML)
- `-OutputPath`: Path where the report will be saved
- `-Severity`: Filter results by minimum severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- `-ExcludeThirdParty`: Skip analysis of recognized third-party modules

## Detection Capabilities

The analyzer can identify various suspicious patterns, including:

- Encoded commands (Base64, compressed scripts)
- Web requests to suspicious domains
- Unusual system modifications
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Credential harvesting techniques
- Common PowerShell attack frameworks patterns
- Suspicious process creation
- Registry modifications
- Evasion techniques

## Example Report
